# Python WebScrapper v1.0

This is a web scrapper desgined to gather UD course data. The script uses a while loop to visit each URL, grab the data, and store it in a JSON file. The script is incomplete, as is the JSON file, but provides a decent starting point for the scheduler project.

This is a beta. In the next few weeks, I'll have the finshed script and JSON published.
