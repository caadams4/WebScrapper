We read six African novels that help us to better understand life in one part of Africa before the onset of colonialism, the experience of colonialism, the early years of independence, strife and war, the roles of ethnicity, gender and religion, the hope and aspirations of recent political transitions, and the increasing place of 'new diasporas.'",

While the second half provides an overview of many policies, it also uses lengthier case studies to detail the interaction of human dimensions with wildlife conservation. Because wildlife and fisheries management in the 21st century has as much to do with human dimensions, economics and equity, social politics, and environmental policy, as it does ecology principles; this course is designed to prepare students to succeed as wildlife and natural resource professionals.",

Learn the fundamental principles involved in the sustainable management of soil and water resources through the examination of hydrologic and erosion processes. Important environmental topics covered in this course include soils, storm water management, nonpoint source pollution, water and wastewater treatment, wetlands, rainfall, runoff, groundwater, erosion control, and irrigation and drainage. Using basic algebraic principles, students will design vegetative waterways, calculate stormwater runoff, determine evapotranspiration rates, and design basic irrigation and drainage systems.",

While the second half provides an overview of many policies, it also uses lengthier case studies to detail the interaction of human dimensions with wildlife conservation.

    "description": "Sexuality surrounds us, shapes our culture, and informs our political debates, yet it's too rarely the topic of informed conversation. This class will give you the opportunity to learn about the history of American sexuality between 1600 and 2016 and gain an appreciation for its importance to our politics and culture today. We will examine a variety of topics: the history of marriage and the family, pregnancy and childbirth, contraception, abortion, sexual assault and harassment, prostitution, erotica/pornography, sexual reform and \"social purity\" movements, sexuality and racial conflicts, trans*, same-sex desires and communities, the sexual politics of women's emancipation, and the gay rights movement. You will leave this class better informed and empowered to contribute meaningfully to the ongoing American conversation about sexuality.",

Readings and discussion touch on areas including historical and politcal context, influence of non-Christian civilizations on Dante's thought, medieval views on politics and family, and the role and depiction of women. In addition to our close readings of the poem, we examine other textual and visual representations and interpretations, ranging from illuminated manuscripts to recent novels and films, in order to consider the \"afterlife\" of Dante's work and its resonances\u00a0today.",

Issues that include the reliance of the state on violence as means to communicate authority and power as well as the church's use of violence to maintain authority and uniformity of belief in the name of God will form a bridge to more modern events like colonialism and imperialism. Once it was clearly established as an instrument for conveying and enforcing civilization and superiority violence soon took on a more direct and varied role in the mission civilsatrice. The acts became ever more specific with destruction of cultural memory and the humiliation of the victims and their material culture increasingly common. In time, the oppressed came to rely on violence as a weapon to strike back at (and communicate with) their enemies. Indeed, these very exchanges make it clear how well the texts of violence were understood by both sides of the conflict. Finally, the terror and violence too familiar in our own day will form a final few weeks of reading and discussion to try to understand how violence is used today as a weapon by both the weak and the very strongest.",

Humanitarianism claims that all humans have the same right to care and protection, yet in reality human life continues to be unfairly stratified according to race, sexuality, gender, and ability: something that humanitarianism does not automatically solve. In this class, we dig deep into the ways that politics and social position frames humanitarian encounters, and we will particularly focus on the ways that people within groups who receive these interventions-particularly in continental Africa, or in situations of forced migration-themselves perceive and experience them. We go beyond the spectacle of celebrity humanitarianism, and consider instead the historical and cultural specificity of humanitarianism, and the politics of life and death.",

Reproduction is a topic and experience that cuts across multiple political and personal issues: it is at once a deeply intimate and highly public process with implications for both individuals and societies. In this course we identify, examine, and explore dominant narratives about motherhood and reproduction from cross-cultural perspectives, and the personal stakes and political scales at which different experiences of motherhood impact. We focus specifically on motherhood since it is the relationship between mother and child that is predominantly politicized in various configurations of power both historically and contemporaneously, although we do examine topics related to parenthood more broadly. Through the study of ethnographic research, we look critically and cross-culturally at topics related to: contraception, family planning, fertility, pregnancy, birth, early childhood, motherhood, parenthood, child welfare interventions, media and popular cultural representations of motherhood, and labor and work, especially as these topics intersect with concerns related to nationhood, gender, sexuality, racism, class, socio-economic status, religion, politics, ethnicity, and cultural background.\u00a0",

Reproduction is a topic and experience that cuts across multiple political and personal issues: it is at once a deeply intimate and highly public process with implications for both individuals and societies. In this course we identify, examine, and explore dominant narratives about motherhood and reproduction from cross-cultural perspectives, and the personal stakes and political scales at which different experiences of motherhood impact. We focus specifically on motherhood since it is the relationship between mother and child that is predominantly politicized in various configurations of power both historically and contemporaneously, although we do examine topics related to parenthood more broadly. Through the study of ethnographic research, we look critically and cross-culturally at topics related to: contraception, family planning, fertility, pregnancy, birth, early childhood, motherhood, parenthood, child welfare interventions, media and popular cultural representations of motherhood, and labor and work, especially as these topics intersect with concerns related to nationhood, gender, sexuality, racism, class, socio-economic status, religion, politics, ethnicity, and cultural background.\u00a0",

Humanitarianism claims that all humans have the same right to care and protection, yet in reality human life continues to be unfairly stratified according to race, sexuality, gender, and ability: something that humanitarianism does not automatically solve. In this class, we dig deep into the ways that politics and social position frames humanitarian encounters, and we will particularly focus on the ways that people within groups who receive these interventions-particularly in continental Africa, or in situations of forced migration-themselves perceive and experience them. We go beyond the spectacle of celebrity humanitarianism, and consider instead the historical and cultural specificity of humanitarianism, and the politics of life and death.",

In this class, we dig deep into the ways that politics and social position frames humanitarian encounters, and we will particularly focus on the ways that people within groups who receive these interventions-particularly in continental Africa, or in situations of forced migration-themselves perceive and experience them. We go beyond the spectacle of celebrity humanitarianism, and consider instead the historical and cultural specificity of humanitarianism, and the politics of life and death.",
