Humanitarianism claims that all humans have the same right to care and protection, yet in reality human life continues to be unfairly stratified according to race, sexuality, gender, and ability: something that humanitarianism does not automatically solve. In this class, we dig deep into the ways that politics and social position frames humanitarian encounters, and we will particularly focus on the ways that people within groups who receive these interventions-particularly in continental Africa, or in situations of forced migration-themselves perceive and experience them. We go beyond the spectacle of celebrity humanitarianism, and consider instead the historical and cultural specificity of humanitarianism, and the politics of life and death.", "component": "Discussion", "repeatable": "", "allowedUnits": "", "multTermEnrollment": "", "prereqs": [], "crosslisted": ["ANTH 354", "WOMS 354"], "University Breadth": "", "Engineering Breadth": "", "URL": "https://catalog.udel.edu/preview_course.php?coid=275285"}], ["UAPP 417", {"title": "UAPP 417 - Political Economy of the Environment ", "credits": "3", "description": "Uses the framework of political economy and the allocation of power to understand the social and political context of environmental challenges.
